#Description: This script allows to generate Pareto optimal fronts for multiobjective optimization problems (usually the DTLZ and WFG families)
#
#
#IMPORTANT: Remember to run this script from the MOEA framework root folder.
#
#1st parameter: the name of the problem (DTLZ1, WFG5, ...).
#2nd parameter: the dimension of the problem (the number of objectives).
#3rd parameter: number of random Pareto optimal solutions to generate.
#4th parameter: the step for each objective to generate a smaller number of solutions applying the epsilon-dominance.
#5th parameter: the output file where the Pareto optimal front will be stored.
#
#Example: ./ParetoFrontsGeneration.sh DTLZ1 3 100000 0.01 ../pf/DTLZ1.15D.pf
#It generates 100,000 random optimal solutions for the three-objective version of the DTLZ1 problem and add them to an epsilon-dominance archive with epsilons set to (0.01, 0.01, 0.01).
